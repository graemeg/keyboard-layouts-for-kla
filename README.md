# Keyboard Layout for KLA

KLA is a Keyboard Layout Analyser tool. These json files allow you to
import these layouts for your session only, and can then compare them
against other layouts or the built-in layout collection included with
KLA.

This save yoa the time and effort to recreate these layout when you
want to do some experimentation.
